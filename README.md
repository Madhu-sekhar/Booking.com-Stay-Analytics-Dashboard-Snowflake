# Booking.com-Stay-Analytics-Dashboard-Snowflake

Built a hotel analytics dashboard using Snowflake by loading CSV data through internal stages and file formats, transforming data with SQL, and implementing a Bronze–Silver–Gold data model. Created Gold-layer aggregates for bookings and revenue and visualized KPIs using Snowsight.
Future scope includes automated ingestion, incremental loads, role-based access control, and predictive analytics.
